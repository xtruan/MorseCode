# Morse Code
Morse Code app for Garmin ConnectIQ - https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/7f0379de-29af-40ce-975d-151b8713ad30

Portable Morse Code reference guide that goes with you everywhere! Contains letters, numbers, symbols, Prosigns, useful phrases, Q codes, and notes that make up the International Morse Code. Ability to vibrate letter patterns.
NOTE: Only letters can vibrate at the moment due to limitations in the ConnectIQ API (the other items are too long).
Usage:
* Menu soft key or up button to browse categories (Letters, Numbers, Symbols, Prosigns, Phrases, Q Codes, Notes)
* Swipe left or right or press down button to cycle through items in a category
* Press and hold screen or press enter button (start/stop) to vibrate the pattern (letters only)

Make sure vibration is enabled to make the most of this app!

Changelog:
